Predicting Changes in Neighborhood Rent using Restaurant Reviews and Attributes. This project explores the correlation between a neighborhood’s rent prices and the reviews and attributes of that neighborhood’s restaurants. Specifically, we examined neighborhoods in the five boroughs of New York City, using data from the census, Yelp, and StreetEasy.
